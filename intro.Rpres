Why use projects?
========================================================

Code is usually meant to be run more than once. Projects help to maintain good workflow habits:

- **Using fresh R processes** - each project comes with its own environment; restart R regularly to run scripts in _clean_ R environments. Storing variables in your environment can lead to problems later on
- **Portability** - projects have clearly defined base directories; use relative paths to keep projects self-contained and portable -- your collaborators (including future-you!) will thank you

GitHub
========================================================

GitHub is a code storage/sharing platform. Use it to:

- browse source code ([CRAN](https://github.com/cran),  [tidyverse](https://github.com/tidyverse/), [rOpenSci](https://github.com/ropensci), [r-lib](https://github.com/r-lib))
- use packages not on CRAN (`devtools::install_github("account_name/repo_name")`)
- share/store analyses and functions
- browse past versions of code

Cloning GitHub repositories 
========================================================

If you _don't_ have git installed: get GitHub files off the web and onto your local computer by clicking `Download ZIP`.

Cloning GitHub repositories 
========================================================

If you _have_ git installed and ready to go on RStudio (excellent instructions [here](http://happygitwithr.com/)), you can do the following:

(1) FORK the repository (make a copy of it to your github.com account)

(2) In RStudio: `File --> New Project --> Version Control --> Git`. The repository URL should be in the form: `https://github.com/YOUR_ACCOUNT/REPO_NAME`.
